	  <h3>My Journey</h3> 
  			<li>I grew up always admiring how art looked and was created, so I wanted to do it too. Growing up, my drawings progressed in quality and realism with the additional help of art classes from middle school and up. I've learned many valuable things in art, like color theory, identifying shapes, and more. I've had many sketchbooks in my lifespan, full of the good and bad drawings, the things I needed to remember, and important words or phrases from lessons I could've written about in my notebooks but decided not to. Growing up as an aspiring artist, helped me realize that if you need a little help, like a reference picture, that's okay and it doesn't mean you're "cheating", because art isn't a sport or competition, it's a hobby or subject you excel in, and you should be proud of that, and not to let others judge what you love. There is no such thing as a "pro artist" or a "noob" artist, you can still be way old and progress in your art. This isn't just about art, as well. Many other subjects aren't supposed to just be competition, you should enjoy it how you want to.</li>
	 <h3>Most Interesting To Me</h3>
	  	 <ul>
		  <li>What I find most interesting in art is the freedom you have with it. It's your own creation, and you can make anything and everything if you know how to.</li>
		  <li>Another thing in art I find interesting is how you can express yourself and your feelings so easily with just your personal canvas and some art materials.</li>
